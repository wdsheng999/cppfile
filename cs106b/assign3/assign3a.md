Problem Description:
In this problem you will write several recursive functions related to drawing graphics. Recursive graphical patterns are also called fractals.

1. Sierpinski Triangle
For this problem, you will write a recursive function that draws the Sierpinski triangle fractal image. 
Do not use any data structures in your solution such as a Vector, Map, arrays, etc.

```cpp
void drawSierpinskiTriangle(GWindow& gw, double x, double y, double size, int order)
```
